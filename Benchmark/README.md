# Benchmark Dataset

This directory contains the benchmark dataset used for evaluating automated app testing approaches. The benchmark consists of carefully selected test cases that cover various user interaction scenarios and app functionalities.

## Dataset Structure

The benchmark dataset follows the standard structure as described in the main dataset documentation:

```

## Test Case Selection Criteria

The benchmark test cases were selected based on the following criteria:

1. **Interaction Diversity**: Cases that cover various types of user interactions:
   - Basic interactions (clicks, swipes)
   - Text input operations
   - Complex gesture sequences
   - Inter-component navigation

2. **Functionality Coverage**: Test cases that exercise different app functionalities:
   - User authentication
   - Data input/validation
   - Content browsing
   - Media handling
   - Settings configuration

3. **UI Component Variety**: Cases involving different types of UI elements:
   - Standard Android widgets
   - Custom views
   - Dynamic content
   - Nested layouts
