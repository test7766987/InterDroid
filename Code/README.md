## Dataset Collection Tool

We provide a tool for collecting dataset samples. The tool is implemented in Python and uses the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to interact with the Android device. It supports recording operations on the device, including clicks, presses, swipes, inputs, and special events. The recorded operations are stored in a JSON file, along with the screenshots, processed screenshots, UI hierarchy, and other information.

You can find the tool in the `dataset_collection_tool` directory.

And you can find the usage instructions in [data_collection_tool README](./dataset_collection_tool/README.md)
